Assignment 2
Assignment 2 (due: 7th of March 2018)

Goal: Implement Stateful Servers with Servlets

 

Your task is to develop a web-based system that will allow people to retrieve posted messages and to post new messages. To retrieve all posted messages, the user would visit the URN “ALLMESSAGES” or “ALLMESSAGES.html”.

To post a new message the user would visit the URN “NEWMESSAGES” or “NEWMESSAGES.html” where the user could enter the text and submit a message.

Please make sure that you use servlets. You are free to choose any servlet container but Tomcat and Glassfish may be the best solutions.  

 

Marking:

Please present your assignment at the tutorials for marking to the TA. You can also present the assignments to the class instructor.

Goal: Designing for Mobile

 

Your task is to develop a client-server solution using jquery mobile that allows people to at allows people to retrieve posted messages and to post new messages.  

 

This assignment consists of client and server components.

 

a) For the server side, you must develop REST web services in the language Java using Glassfish or Tomcat.

 

a1) Develop a REST web service that allows posting messages. To post a message a user must provide an ID and a message text.

 

a2) Develop a REST web service that allows retrieving the IDs of all posted messages. Make sure that no ID is duplicated in the response.

 

a3) Develop a REST web service that allows retrieving messages. This web service must allow a user to specify if all or only selected messages should be retrieved. Each message should be shown with the associated ID.  A user must be able to select:

All messages

Only messages that have arrived since the last retrieval request of this user.

All messages that have posted by a list IDs

All messages that have not been posted by a list of IDs

 

b) For the client side, you must develop using jquery mobile a client that allows a user:

 

To post a message (with ID)

To retrieve all messages

Only messages that have arrived since the last retrieval request of this user.

All messages that have posted by a list IDs

All messages that have not been posted by a list of IDs




To obtain additional bonus marks (up to 50%) add

 

a) (20% bonus) SSE in server and client - these events should notify the client if new messages are available

b) (30% bonus) web sockets in server and client - use the web sockets as a way to allow chats between clients (via the server).

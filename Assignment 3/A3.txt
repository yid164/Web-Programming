Assignment 3 (due: 21st of March 2018)

Goal: Persistent Storage & Web Services

 

Your task is to develop a client-server solution using web services (SOAP and REST) that allows people to retrieve posted messages and to post new messages. To ensure reliable storage of messages a database (e.g. MySQL) must be used.

This assignment consists of client and server components.

a)     For the server side, you must develop SOAP and REST web services in the language Java using Glassfish or Tomcat.

 

SOAP:
Develop a SOAP web service for retrieving posted messages from the database and develop a SOAP web service for storing messages in the database.

REST:
Develop a REST web service for retrieving posted messages from the database and develop a REST web service for storing messages in the database.

 

b)     For the client side, you must develop in Java 2 standalone applications.  

SOAP:
Develop a standalone application that connects to the SOAP web services and allows a user to add new posts and to retrieve existing posts.

REST:
Develop a standalone application that connects to the REST web services and allows a user to add new posts and to retrieve existing posts.

 

To obtain additional bonus marks (up to 50%) develop a web page that allows users to add new posts and to retrieve existing posts using the web services developed in part a.

a)     (20% bonus) The web page connects to the REST web services developed in part a.

b)     (30% bonus) The web page connects to the SOAP web services developed in part a.
